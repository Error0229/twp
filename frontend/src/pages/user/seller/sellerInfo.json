  "introduction": "Once upon a time, there was a man named John who had a passion for selling powdered soda. He had a small shop in the heart of the city where he would sell his unique blend of powdered soda to his customers. Johnâ€™s powdered soda was different from the other sodas available in the market because it was made from natural ingredients and had no artificial flavors or preservatives."
